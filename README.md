# Tesnov
A 3D rendering of legal graffiti site Tesnov in Prague, Czech Republic. 

I made this project when studying abroad in Prague. It is a 3D rendering based on photos taken at the Tesnov legal graffiti site made as the creative project for the Resistance and Dissent CET class. 

The project showcases a legal graffiti site created in Unity using 2D pictures (taken with a DSLR) and 3D modeled objects to create the environment. 

You can play it online at http://www.devi-a.com/Tesnov or download the repo to ge the Windows exes.
